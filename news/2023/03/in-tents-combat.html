            <h1><b>In-Tents Combat</b></h1>

            <h5><b>3/25/23 | 5:54 PM EST</b></h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Welcome to yet another edition of the FawaStudios™ blog, where only the most insightful and jaw-dropping collections of words are found. I made a poll about which Clown Clear topic I should cover first, and the “Item & Inventory” system came out victorious, if you’d like to participate in future polls make sure to check out my Twitter page (at <a href="https://twitter.com/FawaStudios">twitter.com/FawaStudios</a>).
            </p>

            <h2>The Inventory System</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                There are a variety of items the player can use in Clown Clear, whether for defense, healing, etc. These are categorized into 5 slots: a primary firearm, a primary melee weapon, a secondary weapon (whether it be a small melee weapon or a small firearm), a throwable item, and a healing item.
            </p>

            <h2>The Combat System</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The combat system will be pretty straight forward, featuring a wide array of weapons for use in both long-range and close-range situations. It’s planned to be smoothly incorporated with the gore and damage system I have in mind, hopefully ensuring enjoyable clown slaughtering for the long term.</p>

            <h4>Ranged Combat</h4>
            <p>While the majority of ranged weapons are expected to be guns, there may be a few unique weapons included as well. Firearms will utilize a variety of mechanics, including aim down sights, bullet piercing, and standard mechanics commonly found in other FPS games.</p>
            <h4>Melee Combat</h4>
            <p>
                The melee system will be pretty straight forward, featuring a few different swinging animations in sequence that accurately represent the collision between it and the enemies.
                <br /><br />
                I’ve also been considering the idea of control-based attacks, so moving your mouse down while performing an attack could do an over-head swing. Whether this will be in the game is still undecided, but I think it could add a lot more variety in how you fight.
            </p>
            <h4>Shove / Weapon Bash</h4>
            <p>
                That stuff is cool and all, but you know what’s really fun? Clocking someone upside the head with a pistol, or shoving them off the empire state building (In the game, of course).
                <br /><br />
                Assuming there are no really wonky side effects I have yet to discover, I’m hoping to develop a smooth weapon bash system. Aside from my personal love for shoving game characters (namely in Grand Theft Auto and Left 4 Dead), this will be very helpful when trying to escape the large hordes, as well as providing a cool extra layer of defense.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>That’s all for this update, hopefully soon I’ll be posting some clips of the combat (an early version of course) in action. I’m also going to be posting two more Clown Clear-related blog posts in the coming weeks, so look forward to those. Thanks for reading, and see you in next week’s update.</p>
